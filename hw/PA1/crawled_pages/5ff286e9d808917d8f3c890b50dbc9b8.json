Under this assumption,  (the probability of term occurrence in nonrelevant documents for a query) is  and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(76)\n\n\nIn other words, we can provide a theoretical justification for the most frequently used form of  idf  weighting, which we saw in Section 6.2.1 .\n\n\nThe approximation technique in Equation 76 cannot easily be extended to relevant documents. The quantity  can be estimated in various ways:\n\n\nWe can use the frequency of term occurrence in known relevant documents (if we know some). This is the basis of probabilistic approaches to relevance feedback weighting in a feedback loop, discussed in the next subsection.\n\nCroft and Harper (1979) proposed using a constant in their combination match model. For instance, we might assume that  is constant over all terms  in the query and that . This means that each term has even odds of appearing in a relevant document, and so the  and  factors cancel out in the expression for . Such an estimate is weak, but doesn't disagree violently with our hopes for the search terms appearing in many but not all relevant documents. Combining this method with our earlier approximation for , the document ranking is determined simply by which query terms occur in documents scaled by their idf weighting. For short documents (titles or abstracts) in situations in which iterative searching is undesirable, using this weighting term alone can be quite satisfactory, although in many other circumstances we would like to do better.\n\nGreiff (1998) argues that the constant estimate of  in the Croft and Harper (1979) model is theoretically problematic and \nnot observed empirically: as might be expected,  is shown to rise with .  Based on\nhis data analysis, a plausible proposal would be to use the estimate\n\n.\n\n\n\nIterative methods of estimation, which combine some of the above ideas, are discussed in the next subsection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Next: Probabilistic approaches to relevance\n Up: The Binary Independence Model\n Previous: Probability estimates in theory\n    Contents \n    Index\n\n\n© 2008 Cambridge University PressThis is an automatically generated page.
