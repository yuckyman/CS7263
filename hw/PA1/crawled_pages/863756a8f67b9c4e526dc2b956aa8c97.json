The representation of a set of documents as vectors in a common vector space is known as the  vector space model  and is fundamental to a host of information retrieval operations ranging from scoring documents on a query, document classification and document clustering. We first develop the basic ideas underlying vector space scoring; a pivotal step in this development is the view (Section 6.3.2 ) of queries as vectors in the same vector space as the document collection.\n\n\n\n\nSubsections\n\nDot products\nQueries as vectors\nComputing vector scores\n\n\n\n\n© 2008 Cambridge University PressThis is an automatically generated page.
