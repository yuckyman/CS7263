Partitional\nclustering  always refers to a clustering where each document belongs to\nexactly one cluster. (But in a partitional\nhierarchical clustering (Chapter 17 ) all members of\na cluster are of course also members of its parent.) On the\ndefinition of hard clustering that permits multiple\nmembership, the difference between  soft clustering  and hard\nclustering is that membership values in hard clustering are\neither 0 or 1, whereas they can take on any non-negative value\nin soft clustering.\n\n\nSome researchers distinguish between \n exhaustive \nclusterings\nthat assign each document to a cluster and non-exhaustive\nclusterings, in which some documents will be assigned to no\ncluster. Non-exhaustive clusterings in which each document\nis a member of either no cluster or one cluster are\ncalled \n exclusive . \nWe define clustering to be exhaustive in\nthis book. \n\n\n\n\n© 2008 Cambridge University PressThis is an automatically generated page.
