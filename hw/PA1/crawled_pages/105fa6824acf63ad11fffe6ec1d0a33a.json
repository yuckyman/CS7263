These include:\n\n\nHow fast does it index, that is, how many documents per hour does it\n  index for a certain distribution over document lengths?\n(cf. Chapter 4 )\n\nHow fast does it search, that is, what is its latency as a\n  function of index size?\n\nHow expressive is its query language?  How fast is it\n  on complex queries?\n\nHow large is its document collection, in terms of the number of\n  documents or the collection having information distributed across a\n  broad range of topics? \n\n\nAll these criteria apart from query language expressiveness are\nstraightforwardly measurable: we can quantify the speed or size.\nVarious \nkinds of feature checklists can make query language expressiveness\nsemi-precise.\n\n\n\n\n© 2008 Cambridge University PressThis is an automatically generated page.
