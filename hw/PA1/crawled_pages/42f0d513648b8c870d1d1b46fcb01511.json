In isolated-term correction, we attempt to correct a single query term at a time - even when we have a multiple-term query. The carot example demonstrates this type of correction. Such isolated-term correction would fail to detect, for instance, that the query flew form Heathrow contains a mis-spelling of the term from - because each term in the query is correctly spelled in isolation.\n\n\nWe begin by examining two techniques for addressing isolated-term correction: edit distance, and -gram overlap. We then proceed to context-sensitive correction.\n\n\n\n\n© 2008 Cambridge University PressThis is an automatically generated page.
