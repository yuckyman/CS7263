The standard way to\nmeasure human satisfaction is by various \nkinds of user studies. These might include quantitative measures, both\nobjective, such as time to\ncomplete a task, as well as subjective, such as a score\nfor satisfaction with the search engine, and qualitative measures, such\nas user comments on the search interface.  In this section we will\ntouch on other system aspects that allow quantitative evaluation and\nthe issue of user utility.\n\n\n\n\nSubsections\n\nSystem issues\nUser utility\nRefining a deployed system\n\n\n\n\n© 2008 Cambridge University PressThis is an automatically generated page.
