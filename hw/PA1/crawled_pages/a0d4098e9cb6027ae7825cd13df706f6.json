We first develop further ideas for scoring, beyond vector spaces.  Following this, we will put together all of these elements to outline a complete system. Because we consider a complete system, we do not restrict ourselves to vector space retrieval in this section.  Indeed, our complete system will have provisions for vector space as well as other query operators and forms of retrieval.  In Section 7.3  we will return to how vector space queries interact with other query operators.\n\n\n\n\nSubsections\n\nTiered indexes\nQuery-term proximity\nDesigning parsing and scoring functions\nPutting it all together\n\n\n\n\n© 2008 Cambridge University PressThis is an automatically generated page.
