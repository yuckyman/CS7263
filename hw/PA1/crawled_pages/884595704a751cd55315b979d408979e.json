Informally, the first ensures that there is a sequence of transitions of non-zero probability from any state to any other, while the latter ensures that the states are not partitioned into sets such that all state transitions occur cyclically from one set to another.\n\n\nTheorem.\nFor any ergodic Markov chain, there is a unique  steady-state  probability vector  that is the principal left eigenvector of , such that if  is the number of visits to state  in  steps, then\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(254)\n\n\nwhere  is the steady-state probability for state .\nEnd theorem.\n\nIt follows from Theorem 21.2.1 that the random walk with teleporting results in a unique distribution of steady-state probabilities over the states of the induced Markov chain. This steady-state probability for a state is the PageRank of the corresponding web page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Next: The PageRank computation\n Up: Markov chains\n Previous: Markov chains\n    Contents \n    Index\n\n\n© 2008 Cambridge University PressThis is an automatically generated page.
