In similar fashion, we may write down the score computed by Equation 14 for the three other possible combinations of  and ; this is summarized in Figure 6.6 .\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.6:\nThe four possible combinations of  and .\n\n\n\n\nLet  (respectively, ) denote the number of training examples for which \n and \n and the editorial judgment is Relevant (respectively, Non-relevant).  Then the contribution to the total error in Equation 17 from training examples for which \n and \n is\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(18)\n\n\nBy writing in similar fashion the error contributions from training examples of the other three combinations of values for  and  (and extending the notation in the obvious manner), the total error corresponding to Equation 17 is\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(19)\n\n\n\nBy differentiating Equation 19 with respect to  and setting the result to zero, it follows that the optimal value of  is\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(20)\n\n\n\nExercises.\n\nWhen using weighted zone scoring, is it necessary for all zones to use the same Boolean match function?\n\n\n\nIn Example 6.1.1 above with weights \n and , what are all the distinct score values a document may get?\n\n\n\nRewrite the algorithm in Figure 6.4 \nto the case of more than two query terms.\n\n\n\nWrite pseudocode for the function WeightedZone for the case of two postings lists in Figure 6.4 .\n\n\n\nApply Equation 20 to the sample training set in Figure 6.5  to estimate the best value of  for this sample.\n\n\n\nFor the value of  estimated in Exercise 6.1.3, compute the weighted zone score for each (query, document) example.
