Documents are shown as circles, diamonds and X's.\nThe boundaries  in the figure, which we call\n decision\n  boundaries , are chosen to separate the\nthree classes, but are otherwise arbitrary.  To classify a\nnew document, depicted as a star in the figure, we determine\nthe region it occurs in and assign it the class of that\nregion - China in this case.  Our task in vector\nspace classification is to devise algorithms that compute\ngood boundaries where ``good'' means high classification\naccuracy on data unseen during training.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.3:\nRocchio classification.\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps the\nbest-known way of computing good class boundaries is  Rocchio\nclassification , which uses  centroids  to\ndefine the boundaries.  The centroid of\na class  is computed as the vector average or center of\nmass of its members:\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n(139)\n\n\nwhere   is the\nset of documents in\n\n whose class is : \n. We denote the normalized vector of \nby  (Equation 25 , page 6.3.1 ).\nThree example centroids are shown\nas  solid circles\nin \nFigure 14.3 .\n\n\nThe boundary between two classes in Rocchio\nclassification is the set of points with equal distance\nfrom the two centroids. For example, ,\n, and  in the figure.  This set\nof points is always a line.  \nThe generalization of a line in\n-dimensional space is\na hyperplane, which we define as the set of points \nthat satisfy:\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n(140)\n\n\nwhere  is the -dimensional  normal\nvector  of the hyperplane and  is a constant.  This definition of\nhyperplanes includes lines (any line in 2D can be defined by\n\n) and 2-dimensional planes (any plane in 3D\ncan be defined by \n).  A line divides\na plane in two, a plane divides 3-dimensional space in two,\nand hyperplanes divide higher-dimensional spaces in two.\n\n\nThus, the boundaries of class regions in Rocchio\nclassification are hyperplanes. The classification rule in\nRocchio is to\nclassify a point in accordance with the\nregion it falls into. Equivalently, we determine the\ncentroid \n that the point is closest to and then assign it to .\nAs an example, consider the star\nin Figure 14.3 . It is located in the\nChina region of the space and Rocchio therefore assigns it to China.\nWe show the Rocchio algorithm \nin pseudocode in\nFigure 14.4 .\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 14.1:\nVectors and class centroids for the data in\n  Table 13.1 .\n\n \nterm weights\n\nvector\nChinese\nJapan\nTokyo\nMacao\nBeijing\nShanghai\n\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1.0\n0\n\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1.0\n\n\n0\n0\n0\n1.0\n0\n0\n\n\n0\n0.71\n0.71\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n0\n0.71\n0.71\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n0\n0\n0\n0.33\n0.33\n0.33\n\n\n\n0\n0.71\n0.71\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nWorked example.\nTable 14.1  shows the tf-idf vector representations of the\nfive documents in \n  Table 13.1 \n (page 13.1 ), using the formula \n if\n  \n\n(Equation 29, page 6.4.1 ).\n The two class centroids are\n\n\nand \n\n.\nThe distances of the test document from the centroids are \n\n\nand \n\n. Thus, Rocchio\nassigns  to .\n\n\nThe separating hyperplane in this case has the following parameters:\n\n\n\n\n\nSee Exercise 14.8  for how to compute\n and .\nWe can\neasily verify that this hyperplane separates the documents\nas desired:\n\n (and, similarly,\n\n for  and )\nand \n. Thus, documents in  are\nabove the hyperplane (\n) and\ndocuments in  are below the hyperplane\n(\n).\n\n\nEnd worked example.\n\nThe assignment criterion in\nFigure 14.4  is Euclidean distance (APPLYROCCHIO, line 1). An\nalternative is cosine similarity:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(141)\n\n\nAs\ndiscussed in Section 14.1 , the two\nassignment criteria will sometimes make different\nclassification decisions.\nWe present the Euclidean distance variant of\nRocchio classification here because it \nemphasizes Rocchio's close correspondence \nto  -means clustering (Section 16.4 , page 16.4 ).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.4:\nRocchio classification: Training and\ntesting.\n\n\n\n\nRocchio classification is a form of Rocchio relevance\nfeedback (Section 9.1.1 , page 9.1.1 ).  The\naverage of the relevant documents, corresponding to the most\nimportant component of the Rocchio vector in relevance\nfeedback (Equation 49, page 49 ), is\nthe centroid of the ``class'' of relevant documents. We omit\nthe query component of the Rocchio formula in Rocchio\nclassification since there is no query in text\nclassification.  Rocchio classification can be applied to\n classes whereas Rocchio relevance feedback is designed\nto distinguish only two classes, relevant and nonrelevant.\n\n\nIn addition to respecting contiguity, the classes in Rocchio\nclassification must be approximate spheres with similar radii.\nIn Figure 14.3 , the solid square just\nbelow the boundary between UK and Kenya\nis a better fit for the class UK since UK is\nmore scattered than Kenya. But Rocchio assigns it to\nKenya because it ignores details of the distribution\nof points in a class and only uses distance from the\ncentroid for\nclassification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe assumption of sphericity also does not hold \nin Figure 14.5 . We cannot represent the ``a'' class \nwell with a single prototype because it has two clusters.\nRocchio often misclassifies this type of  multimodal class .\nA text classification example for multimodality is a country like Burma, which \nchanged its name to Myanmar in 1989. The two clusters before and after the name\nchange need not be close to each other in space.\nWe also encountered the problem of  multimodality\nin relevance feedback (Section 9.1.2 , page 9.1.3 ).\n\n\nTwo-class classification is another case where\nclasses are rarely distributed like\nspheres with similar radii. Most two-class classifiers\ndistinguish between a class like China that occupies\na small region of the space and its\nwidely scattered complement. Assuming equal radii will\nresult in a large number of false positives. Most\ntwo-class classification problems therefore require a modified\ndecision rule of the form: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(142)\n\n\nfor a positive constant . As in Rocchio relevance\nfeedback, the centroid of the negative documents is often\nnot used at all, so that the decision criterion simplifies to\n\n  for \na positive constant .\n\n\n\n\n\nmode\ntime complexity\n\ntraining\n\n\n\ntesting\n\n\n\n\nTraining and test times for Rocchio\nclassification.\n\n is the average number of\ntokens  per document. \n and  are the numbers of\ntokens and types, respectively, in the test document. \nComputing Euclidean distance\nbetween the class centroids and a document is \n.\n \n\n\n\nTable 14.2  gives the time complexity of Rocchio\nclassification.  Adding all documents to their respective (unnormalized) centroid is\n\n (as opposed to \n) since we need\nonly consider non-zero entries.  \nDividing each vector sum by the size of its class to compute\nthe centroid is .\nOverall, training time is\nlinear in the size of the collection\n(cf. Exercise 13.2.1 ). Thus, Rocchio\nclassification and Naive Bayes have the same linear training\ntime complexity.\n\n\nIn the next section, we will introduce another\nvector space classification method, kNN, that\ndeals better with classes that have non-spherical,\ndisconnected or other irregular\nshapes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercises.\n\n Show that Rocchio classification can assign a\nlabel to a document that is different from\nits training set label.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Next: k nearest neighbor\n Up: Vector space classification\n Previous: Document representations and measures\n    Contents \n    Index\n\n\n© 2008 Cambridge University PressThis is an automatically generated page.
