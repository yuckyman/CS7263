To illustrate properties\nof document vectors in vector classification,\nwe will render these vectors as points in a plane as in the\nexample in Figure 14.1 . In\nreality, document vectors are length-normalized\nunit vectors that point to the surface of a hypersphere.  We\ncan view the 2D planes in our figures as projections onto a\nplane of the surface of a (hyper-)sphere as shown in\nFigure 14.2 . Distances on the surface of the sphere\nand on the projection plane are approximately the same as\nlong as we restrict ourselves to small areas of the surface\nand choose an appropriate projection\n(Exercise 14.1 ). \n\n\nDecisions of many vector space classifiers are\nbased on a notion of distance, e.g., when computing the nearest\nneighbors in kNN classification.\nWe will use Euclidean\ndistance in this chapter as the underlying distance measure.\nWe observed earlier (Exercise 6.4.4 ,\npage  ) that there is a direct\ncorrespondence between cosine similarity and Euclidean\ndistance for length-normalized vectors. In vector space classification, it\nrarely matters whether the relatedness of two documents is\nexpressed  in terms of similarity or distance.\n\n\nHowever, in addition to documents, centroids or averages of\nvectors also play an important role in vector space\nclassification.  Centroids are not length-normalized. For\nunnormalized vectors, dot product, cosine similarity and\nEuclidean distance all have different behavior in general\n(Exercise 14.8 ).  We will be mostly concerned with\nsmall local regions when computing the similarity between a\ndocument and a centroid, and the smaller the region the more\nsimilar the behavior of the three measures is.\n\n\nExercises.\n\n For small areas, distances on the surface of the hypersphere are\napproximated well by distances on its projection \n(Figure 14.2 )\nbecause\n\n for small angles.
