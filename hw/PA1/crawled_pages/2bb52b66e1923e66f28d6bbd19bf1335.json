Luhn (1957;1958) describes some of\nthe earliest reported applications of term weighting. His\npaper dwells on the importance of medium frequency terms\n(terms that are neither too commonplace nor too rare) and\nmay be thought of as anticipating tf-idf and related\nweighting schemes. Spärck Jones (1972) builds on this intuition\nthrough detailed experiments showing the use of inverse\ndocument frequency in term weighting. A series of extensions\nand theoretical justifications of idf are due to\nSalton and Buckley (1987)\nRobertson and Jones (1976), Croft and Harper (1979) and\nPapineni (2001). Robertson maintains a web page\n(http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~ser/idf.html)\ncontaining the history of idf, including soft copies of\nearly papers that predated electronic versions of journal\narticle.  Singhal et al. (1996a) develop pivoted document\nlength normalization. Probabilistic language models\n(Chapter 11 ) develop weighting techniques that are\nmore nuanced than tf-idf; the reader will find this\ndevelopment in Section 11.4.3 .\n\n\nWe observed that by assigning a weight for each term in a\ndocument, a document may be viewed as a vector of term\nweights, one for each term in the collection. The SMART\ninformation retrieval system at\nCornell (Salton, 1971b) due to Salton and colleagues\nwas perhaps the first to view a document as a vector of\nweights. The basic computation of cosine scores as described\nin Section 6.3.3  is due to Zobel and Moffat (2006).\nThe two query evaluation strategies term-at-a-time and\ndocument-at-a-time are discussed by Turtle and Flood (1995).\n\n\nThe SMART notation for tf-idf term weighting schemes in\nFigure 6.15  is presented in\n(Singhal et al., 1996b;1995, Salton and Buckley, 1988).  Not\nall versions of the notation are consistent; we most closely\nfollow (Singhal et al., 1996b).  A more detailed and\nexhaustive notation was developed in Moffat and Zobel (1998),\nconsidering a larger palette of schemes for term and\ndocument frequency weighting.  Beyond the notation,\nMoffat and Zobel (1998) sought to set up a space of feasible\nweighting functions through which hill-climbing approaches\ncould be used to begin with weighting schemes that performed\nwell, then make local improvements to identify the best\ncombinations.  However, they report that such hill-climbing\nmethods failed to lead to any conclusions on the best\nweighting schemes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Next: Computing scores in a\n Up: Scoring, term weighting and\n Previous: Pivoted normalized document length\n    Contents \n    Index\n\n\n© 2008 Cambridge University PressThis is an automatically generated page.
