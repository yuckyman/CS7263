This can be done by normalizing\ntokens to remove diacritics.  In many other languages, diacritics are a\nregular part of the writing system and distinguish different sounds.\nOccasionally words are distinguished only by their\naccents. For instance, in Spanish, peña is `a cliff', while\npena is `sorrow'. Nevertheless, the important question is usually not\nprescriptive or linguistic but is a question of how users are likely to\nwrite queries \nfor these words. In many cases, users will enter queries for words\nwithout diacritics, whether for reasons of speed, laziness, limited software,\nor habits born of the days when it was hard to use non-ASCII text on\nmany computer systems.  In these cases, it might be best to\nequate all words to a form without diacritics.\n\n\n\n\n© 2008 Cambridge University PressThis is an automatically generated page.
