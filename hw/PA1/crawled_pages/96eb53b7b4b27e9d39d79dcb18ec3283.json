Consider a query with two or more query terms, \n. Let  be the width of the smallest window in a document  that contains all the query terms, measured in the number of words in the window. For instance, if the document were to simply consist of the sentence The quality of mercy is not strained, the smallest window for the query strained mercy would be 4. Intuitively, the smaller that  is, the better that  matches the query. In cases where the document does not contain all of the query terms, we can set  to be some enormous number. We could also consider variants in which only words that are not stop words are considered in computing . Such proximity-weighted scoring functions are a departure from pure cosine similarity and closer to the ``soft conjunctive'' semantics that Google and other web search engines evidently use.\n\n\nHow can we design such a  proximity-weighted  scoring function to depend on ? The simplest answer relies on a ``hand coding'' technique we introduce below in Section 7.2.3 . A more scalable approach goes back to Section 6.1.2  - we treat the integer  as yet another feature in the scoring function, whose importance is assigned by machine learning, as will be developed further in Section 15.4.1 .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Next: Designing parsing and scoring\n Up: Components of an information\n Previous: Tiered indexes\n    Contents \n    Index\n\n\n© 2008 Cambridge University PressThis is an automatically generated page.
