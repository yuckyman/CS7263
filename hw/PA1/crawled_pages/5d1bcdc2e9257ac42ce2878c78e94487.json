For instance, we may wish to retrieve documents containing the term carrot when the user types the query carot. Google reports (http://www.google.com/jobs/britney.html) that the following are all treated as misspellings of the query britney spears: britian spears, britney's spears, brandy spears and prittany spears. We look at two steps to solving this problem: the first based on edit distance and the second based on -gram overlap. Before getting into the algorithmic details of these methods, we first review how search engines provide spell-correction as part of a user experience.\n\n\n\n\nSubsections\n\nImplementing spelling correction\nForms of spelling correction\nEdit distance\nk-gram indexes for spelling correction\nContext sensitive spelling correction\n\n\n\n\n© 2008 Cambridge University PressThis is an automatically generated page.
