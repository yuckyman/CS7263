Our study of link analysis builds on two intuitions:\n\n\nThe anchor text pointing to page B is a good description of page B.\n\nThe hyperlink from A to B represents an endorsement of page B, by the creator of page A.  This is not always the case; for instance, many links amongst pages within a single website stem from the user of a common template.  For instance, most corporate websites have a pointer from every page to a page containing a copyright notice - this is clearly not an endorsement.  Accordingly, implementations of link analysis algorithms will typical discount such ``internal'' links.\n\n\n\n\nSubsections\n\nAnchor text and the web graph\n\n\n\n\n© 2008 Cambridge University PressThis is an automatically generated page.
