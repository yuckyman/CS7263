We discuss some of the principal ones here; a more complete development is deferred to Chapter 11 .  We will summarize these alternatives in Section 6.4.3 (page ).\n\n\n\n\nSubsections\n\nSublinear tf scaling\nMaximum tf normalization\nDocument and query weighting schemes\nPivoted normalized document length\n\n\n\n\n© 2008 Cambridge University PressThis is an automatically generated page.
