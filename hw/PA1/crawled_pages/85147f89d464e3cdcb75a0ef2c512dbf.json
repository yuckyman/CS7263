This method is frequently used by \nweb search engines.\n\n\nThe most common version of this is  A/B testing , a term borrowed from the advertising industry.  For such a test, precisely one thing is changed between the current system and a proposed system, and a small proportion of traffic (say, 1-10% of users) is randomly directed to the\nvariant system, while most users use the current system.\nFor example, if we wish to investigate a change to the ranking\nalgorithm, we redirect a random sample of users to a variant system and evaluate measures such as the frequency with which\npeople click on the top result, or any result on the first page.\n(This particular analysis method is referred to as  clickthrough log analysis  or\n clickstream mining .  It is further discussed as a method of\nimplicit feedback in Section 9.1.7 (page ).)\n\n\nThe basis of A/B testing is running a bunch of single\nvariable tests (either in sequence or in parallel): for each\ntest only one parameter is varied from the control (the\ncurrent live system). It is therefore easy to see whether\nvarying each parameter has a positive or negative effect.\nSuch testing of a live system can easily and cheaply gauge\nthe effect of a change on users, and, with a large enough\nuser base, it is practical to measure even very small\npositive and negative effects. In principle, more analytic\npower can be achieved by varying multiple things at once in\nan uncorrelated (random) way, and doing standard\nmultivariate statistical analysis, such as multiple linear\nregression.  \n\n\nIn\npractice, though, A/B testing is widely used, because A/B\ntests are easy to deploy, easy to understand, and easy to\nexplain to management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Next: Results snippets\n Up: A broader perspective: System\n Previous: User utility\n    Contents \n    Index\n\n\n© 2008 Cambridge University PressThis is an automatically generated page.
