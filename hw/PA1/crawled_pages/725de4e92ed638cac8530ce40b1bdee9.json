We then examine\nin detail some of the \nsubstantive linguistic issues of tokenization and linguistic\npreprocessing, which determine the vocabulary of terms which a system uses\n(Section 2.2 ).  Tokenization is the process of\nchopping character streams \ninto  tokens , while linguistic\npreprocessing then deals \nwith building equivalence classes of tokens which are the set of\n terms  that are \nindexed.  Indexing itself is covered \nin Chapters 1 4 .\nThen we return to the implementation of postings lists.\nIn Section 2.3 , we examine an extended\npostings list data structure that supports faster querying, while \nSection 2.4  covers building postings data structures suitable for \nhandling phrase and proximity queries, of the sort that commonly appear in\nboth extended Boolean models and on the web.\n\n\n\n\nSubsections\n\nDocument delineation and character sequence\n  decoding\n\nObtaining the character sequence in a document\nChoosing a document unit\n\n\nDetermining the vocabulary of terms\n\nTokenization\nDropping common terms: stop words\nNormalization (equivalence classing of terms)\n\nAccents and diacritics.\nCapitalization/case-folding.\nOther issues in English.\nOther languages.\n\nStemming and lemmatization\n\n\nFaster postings list intersection via skip pointers\nPositional postings and phrase queries\n\nBiword indexes\nPositional indexes\n\nPositional index size.\n\nCombination schemes\n\n\nReferences and further reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Next: Document delineation and character\n Up: irbook\n Previous: References and further reading\n    Contents \n    Index\n\n\n© 2008 Cambridge University PressThis is an automatically generated page.
