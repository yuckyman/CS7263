Accordingly, there has been considerable research into variants of term frequency that go beyond counting the number of occurrences of a term. A common modification is to use instead the logarithm of the term frequency, which assigns a weight given by\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(28)\n\n\n\nIn this form, we may replace  by some other function  as in (28), to obtain:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n(29)\n\n\nEquation (23) can then be modified by replacing tf-idf by wf-idf as defined in (29).\n\n\n\n\n© 2008 Cambridge University PressThis is an automatically generated page.
