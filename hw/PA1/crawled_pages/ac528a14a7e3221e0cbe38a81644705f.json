Often  is nothing more than a good guess based\non experience or domain knowledge.  But for  -means, we will\nalso introduce a heuristic method for choosing  and an\nattempt to incorporate the selection of  into the\nobjective function.  Sometimes the application puts\nconstraints on the range of .  For example, the\nScatter-Gather interface in Figure 16.3  could not\ndisplay more than about  clusters per layer because of\nthe size and resolution of computer monitors in the early 1990s.\n\n\nSince our goal is to optimize an objective function,\nclustering is essentially a search problem.  The brute force\nsolution would be to enumerate all possible clusterings and\npick the best.  However, \nthere are exponentially many \npartitions, so this approach is not\nfeasible. For this reason, most flat\nclustering algorithms refine an initial partitioning\niteratively.  If the search starts at an unfavorable initial\npoint, we may miss the global optimum. Finding a good\nstarting point is therefore another important problem we\nhave to solve in flat clustering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Next: Evaluation of clustering\n Up: Problem statement\n Previous: A note on terminology.\n    Contents \n    Index\n\n\n© 2008 Cambridge University PressThis is an automatically generated page.
