Both techniques share a common strategy: express the given wildcard query  as a Boolean query  on a specially constructed index, such that the answer to  is a superset of the set of vocabulary terms matching . Then, we check each term in the answer to  against , discarding those vocabulary terms that do not match . At this point we have the vocabulary terms matching  and can resort to the standard inverted index.\n\n\n\n\n\nSubsections\n\nPermuterm indexes\n\n\n\n\n© 2008 Cambridge University PressThis is an automatically generated page.
