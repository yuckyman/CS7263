Table 10.1  is inspired by a similar\ntable in (van Rijsbergen, 1979).\nSection 10.4  follows the overview of INEX 2002 by\nGövert and Kazai (2003), published in the proceedings of\nthe meeting (Fuhr et al., 2003a). The proceedings of the four\nfollowing INEX meetings were published as\nFuhr et al. (2003b), Fuhr et al. (2005), Fuhr et al. (2006), and Fuhr et al. (2007). An uptodate overview article is Fuhr and Lalmas (2007).\nThe results in Table 10.4  are from (Kamps et al., 2006).\nChu-Carroll et al. (2006) also present evidence that XML\nqueries increase precision compared with\nunstructured queries.\nInstead of coverage and relevance, INEX now evaluates on the\nrelated but different dimensions of\nexhaustivity and specificity\n(Lalmas and Tombros, 2007). Trotman et al. (2006) relate the tasks\ninvestigated at INEX to real world uses of structured\nretrieval such as structured book search on internet\nbookstore sites.\n\n\nThe structured document retrieval principle is due to\nChiaramella et al. (1996).\nFigure 10.5  is from (Fuhr and Großjohann, 2004). \nRahm and Bernstein (2001) give a survey of automatic schema\nmatching that is applicable to XML. The vector-space based XML retrieval method in\nSection 10.3  is essentially IBM Haifa's JuruXML system\nas presented by Mass et al. (2003) and Carmel et al. (2003).\nSchlieder and Meuss (2002) and Grabs and Schek (2002)\ndescribe similar approaches.\nCarmel et al. (2003)\nrepresent queries as  XML\nfragments . The trees that represent XML queries\nin this chapter are all XML fragments, but XML fragments\nalso permit the operators ,  and\nphrase on content nodes.\n\n\nWe chose to present the vector space model for XML retrieval\nbecause it is simple and a natural extension of the\nunstructured vector space model in Chapter 6 .\nBut many other unstructured retrieval methods have been\napplied to XML retrieval with at least as much success as\nthe vector space model. These methods include language\nmodels (cf. Chapter 12 , e.g.,\nKamps et al. (2004), Ogilvie and Callan (2005), List et al. (2005)),\nsystems that use a relational database as a\nbackend (Theobald et al., 2008;2005, Mihajlovic et al., 2005),\nprobabilistic weighting (Lu et al., 2007), and fusion\n(Larson, 2005).  There is currently no consensus as\nto what the best approach to XML retrieval is.\n\n\nMost early work on XML retrieval accomplished relevance\nranking by focusing on individual terms, including their structural\ncontexts,  in query and document.\nAs in unstructured information retrieval, there is a trend\nin more recent work\nto model relevance ranking as combining evidence from\ndisparate measurements about the query, the document and\ntheir match. The combination function can be tuned manually\n(Sigurbjörnsson et al., 2004, Arvola et al., 2005)\nor trained using machine learning methods\n(Vittaut and Gallinari (2006), cf. mls).\n\n\nAn active area of XML retrieval\nresearch is  focused retrieval \n(Trotman et al., 2007), which aims to avoid returning\nnested elements that share one or more common subelements\n(cf. discussion in Section 10.2 ,\npage 10.2 ).  \nThere is evidence that users dislike redundancy caused by\nnested elements\n(Betsi et al., 2006).\nFocused retrieval requires evaluation\nmeasures that penalize redundant results lists\n(Kazai and Lalmas, 2006, Lalmas et al., 2007).\nTrotman and Geva (2006) argue that XML retrieval is a form\nof  passage retrieval .\nIn passage retrieval (Kaszkiel and Zobel, 1997, Salton et al., 1993, Hearst and Plaunt, 1993, Hearst, 1997, Zobel et al., 1995),\nthe retrieval system returns short\npassages instead of documents in response to a user\nquery. While element boundaries in XML documents are cues\nfor identifying good segment boundaries between passages,\nthe most relevant passage often does not coincide with an\nXML element.\n\n\nIn the last several years, the query format at INEX has been\nthe NEXI standard proposed by\nTrotman and Sigurbjörnsson (2004).\nFigure 10.3  is from their paper.\nO'Keefe and Trotman (2004) give evidence that\nusers cannot reliably distinguish the child and descendant\naxes. This justifies only permitting descendant axes in \nNEXI (and\nXML\nfragments).  These structural constraints were only\ntreated as ``hints'' in recent INEXes. Assessors can judge\nan element highly relevant even though it violates one of\nthe structural constraints specified in a NEXI query.\n\n\nAn\nalternative to structured query languages like NEXI is a more sophisticated user\ninterface for query formulation\n(Tannier and Geva, 2005, van Zwol, 2006, Woodley and Geva, 2006).\n\n\nA broad overview of XML retrieval that covers database as well\nas IR approaches is given by Amer-Yahia and Lalmas (2006) and an\nextensive reference list on the topic can be found in\n(Amer-Yahia et al., 2005). Chapter 6 of\nGrossman and Frieder (2004) is a good introduction\nto structured text retrieval from a database perspective.\nThe proposed standard for XQuery is available at\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/xquery/ including an\nextension for full-text queries (Amer-Yahia et al., 2006):\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-full-text/.\nWork that has\nlooked at combining the relational database and the\nunstructured information retrieval approaches includes\n(Fuhr and Rölleke, 1997), (Navarro and Baeza-Yates, 1997),\n(Cohen, 1998), and (Chaudhuri et al., 2006).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Next: Exercises\n Up: XML retrieval\n Previous: Text-centric vs. data-centric XML\n    Contents \n    Index\n\n\n© 2008 Cambridge University PressThis is an automatically generated page.
