For instance, you might wish to equate ne'er\nand never or the British spelling colour and the American\nspelling color.  Dates, times and similar items come in multiple\nformats, presenting\nadditional challenges.  You might wish to collapse together\n3/12/91 and Mar. 12, 1991.  However, correct processing\nhere is complicated by the fact that in the U.S., 3/12/91 is\nMar. 12, 1991, whereas in Europe it is 3 Dec 1991.\n\n\n\n\n© 2008 Cambridge University PressThis is an automatically generated page.
