Let  be the cost of not retrieving\na relevant document and  the cost of retrieval of a\nnonrelevant document. Then the Probability Ranking\nPrinciple says that\nif for a specific document  and\nfor all documents  not yet retrieved\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(62)\n\n\nthen  is the next document to be retrieved. Such a model gives a formal framework where we can model differential costs of false positives and false negatives and even system performance issues at the modeling stage, rather than simply at the evaluation stage, as we did in Section 8.6 (page ).  However, we will not further consider loss/utility models in this chapter.\n\n\n\n\n© 2008 Cambridge University PressThis is an automatically generated page.
