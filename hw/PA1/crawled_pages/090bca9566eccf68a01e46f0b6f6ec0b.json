An early experiment about 1960 cited by\nSwanson (1988) found that only 11 out of 23 documents\nproperly indexed under the subject toxicity had any use of a\nword containing the stem toxi.  There is also the issue of\ntranslation, of users knowing what terms a document will use.\nBlair and Maron (1985) conclude that ``it is impossibly difficult\nfor users to predict the exact words, word combinations, and phrases\nthat are used by all (or most) relevant documents and only (or\nprimarily) by those documents''.\n\n\nThe main initial papers on relevance feedback using vector space models\nall appear in Salton (1971b), including the presentation of the\nRocchio algorithm (Rocchio, 1971) and the Ide\ndec-hi variant along with evaluation of several variants (Ide, 1971).\nAnother variant is to regard all documents in the collection\napart from those judged relevant as nonrelevant, rather than only ones\nthat are explicitly judged nonrelevant. However,\nSchütze et al. (1995) and Singhal et al. (1997)\nshow that better results are obtained for routing by using only\ndocuments close to the query of interest rather than all documents.\nOther later work includes Salton and Buckley (1990), Riezler et al. (2007) (a statistical NLP\napproach to RF)\nand the recent survey paper Ruthven and Lalmas (2003).\n\n\nThe effectiveness of interactive relevance feedback systems is discussed\nin (Harman, 1992, Buckley et al., 1994b, Salton, 1989).\nKoenemann and Belkin (1996) do user studies of the effectiveness of\nrelevance feedback.\n\n\nTraditionally Roget's thesaurus has been the best known English language\nthesaurus (Roget, 1946).  In recent computational work, people almost\nalways use WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), not only because it is free, but\nalso because of its rich link structure.  It is available at:\nhttp://wordnet.princeton.edu.\n\n\nQiu and Frei (1993) and Schütze (1998) discuss automatic thesaurus generation.\nXu and Croft (1996) explore using both local and global query expansion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Next: XML retrieval\n Up: Relevance feedback and query\n Previous: Automatic thesaurus generation\n    Contents \n    Index\n\n\n© 2008 Cambridge University PressThis is an automatically generated page.
