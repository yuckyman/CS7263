Sections 19.1 -19.4  provide some background and history to help the reader appreciate the forces that conspire to make the Web chaotic, fast-changing and (from the standpoint of information retrieval) very different from the ``traditional'' collections studied thus far in this book. Sections 19.5 -19.6  deal with estimating the number of documents indexed by web search engines, and the elimination of duplicate documents in web indexes, respectively. These two latter sections serve as background material for the following two chapters.\n\n\nSubsections\n\nBackground and history\nWeb characteristics\n\nThe web graph\nSpam\n\n\nAdvertising as the economic model\nThe search user experience\n\nUser query needs\n\n\nIndex size and estimation\nNear-duplicates and shingling\nReferences and further reading\n\n\n\n\n© 2008 Cambridge University PressThis is an automatically generated page.
