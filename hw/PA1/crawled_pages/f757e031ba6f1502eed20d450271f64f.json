Often,\nupweighting title words is particularly effective\n(Cohen and Singer, 1999, p. 163).  As a rule of thumb, it is often effective to\ndouble the weight of title words in text classification problems.\nYou can also get value from upweighting words from pieces of text that\nare not so much clearly defined zones, but where nevertheless\nevidence from document structure or content suggests that they are important.\nMurata et al. (2000) suggest that you can also get value (in an ad\nhoc retrieval context) from upweighting the first sentence of a\n(newswire) document.  \n\n\n\n\n© 2008 Cambridge University PressThis is an automatically generated page.
