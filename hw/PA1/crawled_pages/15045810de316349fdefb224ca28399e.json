This issue, known as  synonymy , has an impact on the recall of most information retrieval systems. For example, you would want a search for aircraft to match plane (but only for references to an airplane, not a woodworking plane), and for a search on thermodynamics to match references to heat in appropriate discussions.  Users often attempt to address this problem themselves by manually refining a query, as was discussed in Section 1.4 ; in this chapter we discuss ways in which a system can help with query refinement, either fully automatically or with the user in the loop.\n\n\nThe methods for tackling this problem split into two major classes:\nglobal methods and local methods. Global methods are techniques for expanding or reformulating query terms independent of the query and results returned from it, so that changes in the query wording will cause the new query to match other semantically similar terms. Global methods include:\n\n\nQuery expansion/reformulation with a thesaurus or WordNet\n  (Section 9.2.2 )\n\nQuery expansion via automatic thesaurus generation (Section 9.2.3 )\n\nTechniques like spelling correction (discussed in Chapter 3 )\n\n\nLocal methods adjust a query relative to the documents that initially appear to match the query. The basic methods here are:\n\n\nRelevance feedback (Section 9.1 )\n\nPseudo relevance feedback, also known as Blind relevance feedback\n  (Section 9.1.6 )\n\n(Global) indirect relevance feedback (Section 9.1.7 )\n\n\nIn this chapter, we will mention all of these approaches, but we will\nconcentrate on relevance feedback, which is one of the most used and\nmost successful approaches.\n\n\n\n\nSubsections\n\nRelevance feedback and pseudo relevance feedback\n\nThe Rocchio algorithm for relevance feedback\n\nThe underlying theory.\nThe Rocchio (1971) algorithm.\n\nProbabilistic relevance feedback\nWhen does relevance feedback work?\nRelevance feedback on the web\nEvaluation of relevance feedback strategies\nPseudo relevance feedback\nIndirect relevance feedback\nSummary\n\n\nGlobal methods for query reformulation\n\nVocabulary tools for query reformulation\nQuery expansion\nAutomatic thesaurus generation\n\n\nReferences and further reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Next: Relevance feedback and pseudo\n Up: irbook\n Previous: References and further reading\n    Contents \n    Index\n\n\n© 2008 Cambridge University PressThis is an automatically generated page.
