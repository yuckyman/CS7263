One is called its  hub score  and the other its  authority score . For any query, we compute two ranked lists of results rather than one.  The ranking of one list is induced by the hub scores and that of the other by the authority scores.\n\n\nThis approach stems from a particular insight into the creation of web pages, that there are two primary kinds of web pages useful as results for broad-topic searches. By a broad topic search we mean an informational query such as \"I wish to learn about leukemia\". There are authoritative sources of information on the topic; in this case, the National Cancer Institute's page on leukemia would be such a page. We will call such pages authorities; in the computation we are about to describe, they are the pages that will emerge with high authority scores.\n\n\nOn the other hand, there are many pages on the Web that are hand-compiled lists of links to authoritative web pages on a specific topic. These hub pages are not in themselves authoritative sources of topic-specific information, but rather compilations that someone with an interest in the topic has spent time putting together. The approach we will take, then, is to use these hub pages to discover the authority pages. In the computation we now develop, these hub pages are the pages that will emerge with high hub scores.\n\n\nA good hub page is one that points to many good authorities; a good authority page is one that is pointed to by many good hub pages. We thus appear to have a circular definition of hubs and authorities; we will turn this into an iterative computation. Suppose that we have a subset of the web containing good hub and authority pages, together with the hyperlinks amongst them. We will iteratively compute a hub score and an authority score for every web page in this subset, deferring the discussion of how we pick this subset until Section 21.3.1 .\n\n\nFor a web page  in our subset of the web, we use  to denote its hub score and  its authority score. Initially, we set  for all nodes . We also denote by  the existence of a hyperlink from  to . The core of the iterative algorithm is a pair of updates to the hub and authority scores of all pages given by Equation 262, which capture the intuitive notions that good hubs point to good authorities and that good authorities are pointed to by good hubs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(262)\n\n\n\n\n(263)\n\n\nThus, the first line of Equation 262 sets the hub score of page  to the sum of the authority scores of the pages it links to. In other words, if  links to pages with high authority scores, its hub score increases. The second line plays the reverse role; if page  is linked to by good hubs, its authority score increases.\n\n\nWhat happens as we perform these updates iteratively, recomputing hub scores, then new authority scores based on the recomputed hub scores, and so on? Let us recast the equations Equation 262 into matrix-vector form. Let  and  denote the vectors of all hub and all authority scores respectively, for the pages in our subset of the web graph. Let  denote the adjacency matrix of the subset of the web graph that we are dealing with:  is a square matrix with one row and one column for each page in the subset. The entry  is 1 if there is a hyperlink from page  to page , and 0 otherwise. Then, we may write Equation 262\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(264)\n\n\n\n\n(265)\n\n\nwhere  denotes the transpose of the matrix . Now the right hand side of each line of Equation 264 is a vector that is the left hand side of the other line of Equation 264. Substituting these into one another, we may rewrite Equation 264 as\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(266)\n\n\n\n\n(267)\n\n\nNow, Equation 266 bears an uncanny resemblance to a pair of eigenvector equations (Section 18.1 ); indeed, if we replace the  symbols by  symbols and introduce the (unknown) eigenvalue, the first line of Equation 266 becomes the equation for the eigenvectors of , while the second becomes the equation for the eigenvectors of :\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(268)\n\n\n\n\n(269)\n\n\nHere we have used  to denote the eigenvalue of  and  to denote the eigenvalue of .\n\n\nThis leads to some key consequences:\n\n\nThe iterative updates in Equation 262 (or equivalently, Equation 264), if scaled by the appropriate eigenvalues, are equivalent to the power iteration method for computing the eigenvectors of  and . Provided that the principal eigenvalue of  is unique, the iteratively computed entries of  and  settle into unique steady-state values determined by the entries of  and hence the link structure of the graph.\n\nIn computing these eigenvector entries, we are not restricted to using the power iteration method; indeed, we could use any fast method for computing the principal eigenvector of a stochastic matrix.\n\n\n\nThe resulting computation thus takes the following form:\n\n\nAssemble the target subset of web pages, form the graph induced by their hyperlinks and compute  and .\n\nCompute the principal eigenvectors of  and  to form the vector of hub scores  and authority scores .\n\nOutput the top-scoring hubs and the top-scoring authorities.\n\n\nThis method of link analysis is known as  HITS , which is an acronym for Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search.\n\n\nWorked example.\nAssuming the query jaguar and double-weighting of links whose anchors contain the query word, the matrix  for Figure 21.4  is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(270)\n\n\n\nThe hub and authority vectors are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(271)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(272)\n\n\n\nHere,  is the main authority - two hubs ( and )\nare pointing to it via highly weighted jaguar links.\n\n\nEnd worked example.\n\nSince the iterative updates captured the intuition of good hubs and good authorities, the high-scoring pages we output would give us good hubs and authorities from the target subset of web pages. In Section 21.3.1  we describe the remaining detail: how do we gather a target subset of web pages around a topic such as leukemia?\n\n\n\n\nSubsections\n\nChoosing the subset of the Web\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Next: Choosing the subset of\n Up: Link analysis\n Previous: Topic-specific PageRank\n    Contents \n    Index\n\n\n© 2008 Cambridge University PressThis is an automatically generated page.
